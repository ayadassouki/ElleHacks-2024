Winter Made Easier
## Inspiration
  Inspired by the community's need for a unified response to winter hazards, we created a platform that not only alerts but also solves these issues collaboratively.

## How does it work
 It allows users to report environmental hazards and volunteers to find nearby locations requiring immediate attention, streamlining community-led interventions.

## How we built it
Leveraging Google Maps API and responsive web design using JS along with html and css for the frontend and mongo db for the backend, we built a user-friendly interface for real-time updates and community engagement.

## Challenges we ran into
 Balancing user accessibility with real-time functionality presented a unique challenge, as did ensuring accurate location reporting.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
 As a team, we are proud that we were able to make our thoughts come to action within such a limited time frame as we not only implemented skills we are familiar with but also learned new skills such as mangodb over night to implement the backend side of the project.

## What we learned
Not only did we learn new coding skills, but also we felt the deep connection of what team effort is as we all worked together to get this idea into reality.

## What's next for Winter made easier
 Due to the time constraint, we were not able to fully establish the map and fully integrate the submission forms with the real time updates.
